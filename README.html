<p><i>curn</i> is an RSS reader. It scans a configured set of URLs, each
one representing an RSS feed, and summarizes the results. By default,
<i>curn</i> keeps track of individual items within each RSS feed, using an
on-disk cache; when using the cache, it will suppress displaying
information for items it has already processed.</p>

<p>Unlike many RSS readers, <i>curn</i> does not use a graphical user
interface. It is a command-line utility, intended to be run periodically in
the background by a command scheduler such as <i>cron</i>(8) (on Unix-like
systems) or the Windows Scheduler Service (on Windows).</p>

<p><i>curn</i> can read RSS feeds from any URL that's supported by Java's
runtime. When querying HTTP sites, <i>curn</i> uses the HTTP
<tt>If-Modified-Since</tt> and <tt>Last-Modified</tt> headers to suppress
retrieving and processing feeds that haven't changed. By default, it also
requests that the remote HTTP server gzip the XML before sending it. (Some
HTTP servers honor the request; some don't.) These measures both minimize
network bandwidth and ensure that <i>curn</i> is as kind as possible to the
remote RSS servers.</p>

PREREQUISITES:

Before running curn, you'll need:

1. The Informa library, available at http://informa.sourceforge.net/
   Curn has been tested with version 0.5.0.

2. A version of the Jakarta Commons logging library. A version comes
   with Informa, and it works fine. The official distribution is here:
   http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging.html

3. JDOM. Just use the jdom.jar that comes with Informa.

4. An XML parser. Xerces or JAXP will do.

5. The clapper.org utility library, available at
   http://software.clapper.org/java/util/

6. curn.jar. (See BUILDING.txt)

Put these jars/classes somewhere, and make sure they're in your CLASSPATH.

To run curn:

	java org.clapper.curn.curn [options] configFile

Run with no arguments for a usage summary.

See the sample configuration file for more details on configuring.

Version 1.3:

- When cacheing an item, the cache key is now computed from both the item's
  URL and the item's ID, instead of just the ID (If the XML for the item
  provides no ID, then the URL is used exclusively, as before.) This change
  fixes cacheing for (broken) RSS feeds that provide different IDs for the
  same URL.


Version 1.2:

- First version of curn posted to the web.

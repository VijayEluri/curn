Version 1.3.2:

- Added adapter classes for the rsslib4j RSS parser. (See
  http://rsslib4j.sourceforge.net/). Tested with rsslib4j version 0.2 Note
  that this is largely demoware (or proof-of-concept-ware). Like Informa,
  rsslib4j doesn't (yet) support the Atom RSS format, whereas curn's
  built-in MiniRSSParser does.


Version 1.3.1:

- HTMLOutputHandler now displays channel link properly.


Version 1.3:

- Fixed some cacheing bugs and problems. First, cache lookups are now
  consistent. Second, the cache now supports lookups by item ID and item
  URL, not just ID, and curn will check for the URL if the item isn't
  cached by ID. (Some RSS feeds provide a unique ID for each item. Some
  don't.) This change fixes cacheing for (broken) RSS feeds that provide
  different IDs for the same URL. I've seen at least one site where the
  ID for a given item changes daily, even though the item and its link do
  not.


Version 1.2:

- First version of curn posted to the web.

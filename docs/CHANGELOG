Version 1.3.3:

- Fixed slight problem when translating embedded newlines into spaces in
  parsed XML character data.


Version 1.3.2:

- Now handles feeds with alternate character sets (e.g., UTF-8) better.
  Note that there's still the possibility of information loss if a feed
  with an alternate character set such as UTF-8 is saved to a local file,
  and the local file is then parsed by curn. That's because curn currently
  doesn't have a way to save the original character set, so it converts the
  feed to the Java VM's native character set before saving it to the local
  file.

- Added adapter classes for the Rome RSS parser. (See
  https://rome.dev.java.net/). Test with Rome 0.3. Rome supports all the
  current RSS feed types.

  NOTE: Rome requires version 1.0 of JDOM (http://www.jdom.org/)


Version 1.3.1:

- HTMLOutputHandler now displays channel link properly.


Version 1.3:

- Fixed some cacheing bugs and problems. First, cache lookups are now
  consistent. Second, the cache now supports lookups by item ID and item
  URL, not just ID, and curn will check for the URL if the item isn't
  cached by ID. (Some RSS feeds provide a unique ID for each item. Some
  don't.) This change fixes cacheing for (broken) RSS feeds that provide
  different IDs for the same URL. I've seen at least one site where the
  ID for a given item changes daily, even though the item and its link do
  not.


Version 1.2:

- First version of curn posted to the web.

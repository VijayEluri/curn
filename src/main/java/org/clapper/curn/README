Even though ant compiles everything at once, to avoid package cycles the
code is organized so that each package and subpackage *could* be compiled
individually, as long as they're compiled in this order:

- org.clapper.curn.parser
- org.clapper.curn
- org.clapper.curn.output
- org.clapper.curn.output.freemarker
- org.clapper.curn.output.script
- org.clapper.curn.plugins

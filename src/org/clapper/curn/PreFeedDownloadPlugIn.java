     * <p>Called just before a feed is downloaded. This method can return
     * <tt>false</tt> to signal <i>curn</i> that the feed should be
     * skipped. The plug-in method can also set values on the
     * <tt>URLConnection</tt> used to download the plug-in, via
     * <tt>URL.setRequestProperty()</tt>. (Note that <i>all</i> URLs, even
     * <tt>file:</tt> URLs, are passed into this method. Setting a request

     *   <li>changing the default User-Agent value

     *                  be used to download the feed's XML.

    /**
     * Called immediately after a feed is parsed, but before it is
     * otherwise processed. A post-feed parse plug-in has access to the
     * <i>parsed</i> RSS feed data, via an {@link RSSChannel} object. This
     * method can return <tt>false</tt> to signal <i>curn</i> that the feed
     * should be skipped. For instance, a plug-in that filters on the
     * parsed feed data could use this method to weed out non-matching
     * feeds before they are downloaded. Similarly, a plug-in that edits
     * the parsed data (removing or editing individual items, for instance)
     * could use method to do so.
     *
     * @param feedInfo  the {@link FeedInfo} object for the feed that
     *                  has been downloaded and parsed.
     * @param channel   the parsed channel data
     *
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if <i>curn</i> should continue to process the
     *         feed, <tt>false</tt> to skip the feed. A return value of
     *         <tt>false</tt> aborts all further processing on the feed.
     *         In particular, <i>curn</i> will not pass the feed along to
     *         other plug-ins that have yet to be notified of this event.

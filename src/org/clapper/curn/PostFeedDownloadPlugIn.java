    /**
     * Called immediately after a feed is downloaded. This method can
     * return <tt>false</tt> to signal <i>curn</i> that the feed should be
     * skipped. For instance, a plug-in that filters on the unparsed XML
     * feed content could use this method to weed out non-matching feeds
     * before they are downloaded.
     *
     * @param feedInfo      the {@link FeedInfo} object for the feed that
     *                      has been downloaded
     * @param feedDataFile  the file containing the downloaded, unparsed feed 
     *                      XML. <b><i>curn</i> may delete this file after all
     *                      plug-ins are notified!</b>
     * @param encoding      the encoding used to store the data in the file,
     *                      or null for the default
     *
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if <i>curn</i> should continue to process the
     *         feed, <tt>false</tt> to skip the feed. A return value of
     *         <tt>false</tt> aborts all further processing on the feed.
     *         In particular, <i>curn</i> will not pass the feed along to
     *         other plug-ins that have yet to be notified of this event.

<p><i>curn</i>: Customizable Utilitarian RSS Notifier.</p>

<p><i>curn</i> is an RSS feed reader. It scans a configured set of URLs,
each one representing an RSS feed, and summarizes the results in an
easy-to-read text format. <i>curn</i> keeps track of URLs it's seen before,
using an on-disk cache; when using the cache, it will suppress displaying
URLs it has already reported (though that behavior can be disabled).
<i>curn</i>
can be extended to use any RSS parser; by default, it uses the
ROME parser.</p>
